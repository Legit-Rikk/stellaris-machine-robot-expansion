 ## TRADITIONS
#  machine_age.4110.desc: "Preliminary research suggests electromechanical constructs called §Ynanites§! present a promising vector for advancement. While rare, they possess unique qualities, including programmability, self-replication, and the ability to form a 'swarm intellect.'\n\nThis technology offers unmatched transformational capabilities, but the requirements to support it remain unclear.\n\nPotential: significant; scalable. Cost: unknown. Additional research required."
#  machine_age.4130.desc: "Research has revealed intriguing applications for §Ynanotechnology§!. Their ability to reconfigure and combine opens up unprecedented versatility in creating megaforms comprised of individual drones. The same technology can generate nano matter or further convert it.\n\nHowever, the process requires time, materials, and energy to be reconfigured. Empire-wide changes are necessary to support deployment.\n\nViability: high; pre-existing nanite lifeforms support the estimation."
#  machine_age.4140.desc: "Our research on §Ynanites§! has concluded. The full extent of their potential remains unclear, but simulations have returned optimistic projections. Their capabilities could prove invaluable in creating specialized megaforms and matter transmutation.\n\nEstimations indicate that the process requires time, materials, and energy to operate in addition to significant structural changes.\n\nViability: promising; transformative."
#  machine_age.4150.desc: "Due to the complexity of the subject matter combined with minimal research effort, our knowledge of §Ynanite§! technology remains rudimentary. The limited projections include nano-replication and reconfiguration as enablers for large-scale structures. Additional resources are likely required to support such projects.\n\nViability: inconclusive."
