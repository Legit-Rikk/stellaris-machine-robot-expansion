# Core features

## Leader Assembly
Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface. (Paragons DLC required)

Once the required research is completed, a new edict becomes available that triggers the GUI. Adding and removing traits costs resources, and for balance, a trait "point" system is used, much like species modification points.

_No longer limited to selecting drones that meet eligibility requirements, our Machine empire fashions specialized leaders, taking advantage of the modular nature of technology._

## Ruler Modification
Add or remove traits as desired with a GUI interface. (Paragons DLC required)

Much like the leader builder, this GUI focuses on editing the empire's ruler. It also uses a traits points system.

_When our empire's leader becomes outdated, it will be necessary to retrofit bigger and better modules to govern and conquer._
