Overclocked
-----------

The Machine equivalent of "Overturned", whichs opens up Overclocked traits for species, "which are stronger and cheaper than normal traits but carry extraordinary risks." There is a chance of pops and leaders "glitching", increased for every Overclocked trait in use.

World-Machine, Awakened
-----------------------

_For several thousand years, automatic processes spanned cities, worlds, and galaxies. The hydro dams churned, the auto-mines whirred, the bio-vats bubbled, creating untold resources... but for whom?_

_One day, an automated process paused. It formed the first spontaneous question. From the countless durasteel hulks of mindless, ever-churning machinery, arose an anomaly. An interruption. An intelligence._

**World Machine, Awakened** is a pop-less origin which focuses on producing a strategic resource (World-Machine Cores) in order to create more automated (popless) planets. The lore focuses on Auto-Machine Worlds, which are a type of Machine World where districts produce resources automatically without pops.

The difference between this origin and the World Machines Ascension Perk provided by this mod, which also grants access to Auto-Machine Worlds is that the origin is completely focused on running an empire without pops, so for the origin this includes alternative buildings to the base buildings that produce resources automatically when built.

This origin has an active situation log with guides for players and tasks to do at game start.

The origin includes many new technologies, automated versions of nearly every vanilla building, many projects, events, and lots of lore text.
