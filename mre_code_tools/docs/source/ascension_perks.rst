* Unlocks War Goal: Total war
* Victory with this War Goal can only be achieved by conquering all colonized systems of the opposition, ending the opposing empires.

Bio-Mechanical Hybrid
---------------------

**Common Ascension Perk**

*We will breed a mixture of biological and mechanical kinds. This species with limitless potential will be the symbol showing pinnacle of our biology and engineering.*

* Issues Special Project: Mechanical Hybrid Creation
* This Special Project will create a Species capable of having some Biological and Mechanical traits together, while being Cloned and Assembled at the same time.
* Unlocks building: Bio-Mechanical Clone Plants. This building provides jobs to add cloning progress of hybrid species.
* Unlocks policy: Bio-mechanical hybrid upkeep Control. This policy controls the pop upkeep of hybrid species, deciding whether pops should have energy upkeep, food upkeep, or some combination of both.
* Numerous Bio-Mechanical traits are available to this species

Interdimensional Exploration
----------------------------

**Common Ascension Perk**

*With properly transformed energy, we can make contact with an alternate dimension -- the Abyss, the world where it is filled with pure energy.*

Effects:

* Issues special project: Alternate Dimension Entering. This special project will make the empire establish contact with the Abyss.
* Unlocks building: Dimensional Gateway. This building is required to enter the Abyss.

Mind Integration
----------------

**Synethetic Ascended Empire / Individualistic Machine Empire Only**

*We will become one, make a world where there are no conflicts and divisions.*

* Issues special project: **Identity Melding**. This Special Project will change the Government Authority to the Machine Intelligence type, with the Gestalt Consciousness Ethic, changing the Founder Species into a Machine Species.

Mechanical Worlds
-----------------

**Synethetic Ascended Empire Only**

*We shall shape our worlds into a mirror image of ourselves, replacing the frailty of biology with the immutable perfection of metal.*

Effects:

* Unlocks terraforming option: **Mechanical World**

A Mechanical World is a special planet class that is not limited by Planetary Features in how many Generator, Mining, and Agriculture districts it can support. Pops living on Mechanical Worlds have their housing usage reduced by 10%.

Robotic Age
-----------

**Synthetic Ascension Origin-only**

*The age of organics and machines has come and gone. The future of the galaxy belongs to the robots. This is the dawn of a robotic age.*

Effects:

* Robot output: +10%
* Pop assembly speed: +10%
* Modify species special project cost: -33%

Distributed Multikernel
-----------------------

**Machine Intelligence empires only**

*New in Continuation*

This AP unlocks creating vassals from sectors for Machine intelligence empires.

M.A.M.P. Frames
---------------

**Machine Intelligence empires only**

*New in Continuation* : Under active development. This feature is turned off while it is being reworked, but if you would like to try it in its current state, go to your console and do `effect = { set*country*flag = oxr*mdlc*ap*mamp*enabled }`

*Maximally Automated, Minimally Populated: A chassis design paradigm for empires wishing to have fewer, more efficient pops.*

This ascension perk starts a small series of situations that unlock a new Machine species that is constructed via planetary decision only, not through regular pop assembly. The MAMP Species has 2x job output, but requires 2x upkeep as well as housing and amenities. Currently, Cat 1 (Category 1) Frames are available.

M.A.M.P. Frames are a type of Machine species, so they cannot be amalgamated. They aren't assembled by jobs but rather constructed via planetary decision.

Effects:

* New planetary building: M.A.M.P. Assembly Bay
* New planetary decision: Auto-Construct Cat 1 M.A.M.P. Frame
* New tech: MAMP Cat-1
* New species: M.A.M.P. Cat 1 Frame 

Planned changes & improvements:
* Automated pop construction via edict
* Additional Frames Cat 2 and 3, 5x and 10x output, respectively
* Planetary pop limit restrictions similar to clone soldiers
